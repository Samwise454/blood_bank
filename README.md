# About the database connection
The database connection has been set up
and running on the server, to call the 
database class, just extend 
the Db class from the class you are 
working on. Then to create a connection,
just call the con() method.
When you extend the Db, it will notify 
for an undefined type error, don't worry about this 
the Db script is already on the server.

# Signup class
Here, the developer will have to add different methods
depending on how it's required. I have created the first one
# addUser method.
